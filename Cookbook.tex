   \emph{Original Notes from Mark}:
   \newline\newline
   I have been asked many times for my Chili recipe but, have kept the secrete
   of this old formula hidden for fear of driving the coast of can beans ski
   high.
   \newline\newline
   Recipe is for five quart crock pot.
   \newline\newline
   Open six ot eight cans of assorted beans.  Drain and rinse.  For maximum
   flagilince do not drain beans.
   \newline\newline
   Add one large can of crushed tomatoes.  If whole tomatoes are used,
   \newline\newline
   a, place them under vehicle tires,
   \newline\newline
   b, run over them repeatedly until they are the consistency of theones you
   could have gotten out of a can
   \newline\newline
   c, scrape off road or dump can into large crock pot.
   \newline\newline
   Grill one pound of ground meat, marinated in soy or teriyaki.  Use ground
   sirloin for good taste, ground round for great taste, or use the really cheep
   fatty shit for the most fabulas tasting stuff your goanna eat.
   \newline\newline
   Add to pot.  Grease and all.  Its chili?
   \newline\newline
   Dice very small, two Jahlo peonies, add to pot.  For more spice, add a
   smidgeon of fresh ground habanera pepper.
   \newline\newline
   Sniff pepper to make sure it is fresh.
   \newline\newline
   Add one pint of honey.  If it is too spicy just add more honey.  It won't
   make it any less hot but it makes it go down easier.
   \newline\newline
   Dice one onion add to pot.
   \newline\newline
   Let it gestate for three hours on low temperature.
   \newline\newline
   Take and serve to buddies at card game.  Don't forget to bring beer!
   \newline\newline
   If you put cheese on it you are queer.
